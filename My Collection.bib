abstract = {The aim of this paper is to reflect on the importance of the students' game-strategic thinking during the development of mathematical activities. In particular, we hypothesise that this type of thinking helps students in the construction of logical links between concepts during the “argumentation phase” of the proving process. The theoretical background of our study lies in the works of J. Hintikka, a Finnish logician, who developed a new type of logic, based on game theory, called the logic of inquiry. In order to experiment with this new approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics, we have prepared five game-activities based on geometric theorems in which two players play against each other in a multi-touch dynamic geometric environment (DGE). In this paper, we present the design of the first game-activity and the relationship between it and the logic of inquiry. Then, adopting the theoretical framework of the instrumental genesis by V{\'{e}}rillon and Rabardel (EJPE 10: 77–101, 1995), we will present and analyse significant actions and dialogues developed by students while they are solving the game. We focus on the presence of a particular way of playing the game introduced by the students, the “reflected game”, and highlight its functions for the development of the task.},

abstract = {Mathematical reasoning is now featured in the mathematics curriculum documents of many nations, but this necessitates changes to teaching practice and hence a need for professional learning. The development of children's mathematical reasoning requires appropriate encouragement and feedback from their teacher who can only do this if they recognise mathematical reasoning in children's actions and words. As part of a larger study, we explored whether observation of educators conducting mathematics lessons can develop teachers' sensitivity in noticing children's reasoning and consideration of how to support reasoning. In the Mathematical Reasoning Professional Learning Research Program, demonstration lessons were conducted in Australian and Canadian primary classrooms. Data sources included post-lesson group discussions. Observation of demonstration lessons and engagement in post-lesson discussions proved to be effective vehicles for developing a professional eye for noticing children's individual and whole-class reasoning. In particular, the teachers noticed that children struggled to employ mathematical language to communicate their reasoning and viewed limitations in language as a major barrier to increasing the use of mathematical reasoning in their classrooms. Given the focus of teachers' noticing of the limitations in some types of mathematical language, it seems that targeted support is required for teachers to facilitate classroom discourse for reasoning.},

abstract = {The purposes of this study are to investigate whether pre-service middle school mathematics teachers evaluate discussions in the cases regarding proof by contradiction correctly, to what extent they explain their correct evaluations by referring to proof by contradiction, and the reasons of their misinterpretations of discussions in the cases regarding proof by contradiction. Data were collected from pre-service middle school mathematics teachers enrolled in a state university in Ankara, Turkey, by asking them to evaluate discussions in two cases related to proof by contradiction. In data analysis, descriptive statistics and item-based analysis were employed. The results of the study indicated that pre-service middle school mathematics teachers are successful in evaluating discussions in the cases regarding proof by contradiction. In terms of year level, it was found that the percentage of the second year students' correct answers was the lowest in both cases. Moreover, the first year students were the most successful group in the first case, and the third year students were the most successful group in the second case. Nearly half of the students explained their correct answers by referring to proof by contradiction in the first case while the percentage of students who explained their correct answers by mentioning proof by contradiction in the second case was considerably low. When incorrect answers of pre-service middle school mathematics teachers were analyzed, two reasons of their misinterpretations of discussions were emerged as “misunderstanding of the assumption” and “perceiving proof as unnecessary”.},

It focuses on students' difficulties as these are related to the object-level and metalevel mathematical learning in group theory, and, when possible, highlights any commognitive conflicts. In the data analysis, one can identify three types of difficulties, relevant to object-level learning: namely regarding the frequently observed confusion between groups and sets, the object-level rules of visual mediators, and the object-level rules of contextual notions, such as permutations, exponentials, sets and matrices. In addition, data analysis suggests two types of difficulties, relevant to metalevel learning. The first refers to the actual proof that the three conditions of subgroup test hold, and the second is related to syntactic inaccuracies, incomplete argumentation and problem-atic use of visual mediators. Finally, this study suggests that there are clear links between object-level and metalevel learning, mainly due to the fact that objectification of the various relevant mathematical notions influences the endorsement of the governing metarules.},

Data from a nationally representative sample of 2343 children participating in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) are examined. In line with international studies, we report moderate correlations between preschool-entry mathematics and later NAPLAN numeracy test results. However, analysis of individual growth trajectories indicates that early mathematics predicts the initial (Year 3) level, but not subsequent growth. This suggests that early mathematical competencies are important for enhancing achievement in early schooling, but that the quality of mathematics education provided in the schooling years is critical for future development.},

Little is known about how teachers and students initiate, develop and maintain norms of mathematical inquiry in primary classrooms. The research question guiding this study is, “How do classroom norms develop that facilitate student learning in primary classrooms which practice mathematical inquiry?” The project will (1) analyse a video archive of inquiry lessons to identify signature practices that enhance productive classroom norms of mathematical inquiry and facilitate learning, (2) engage expert inquiry teachers to collaborate to identify and design strategies for assisting teachers to develop and sustain norms over time that are conducive to mathematical inquiry and (3) support and study teachers new to mathematical inquiry adopting these practices in their classrooms. Anticipated outcomes include identification and illustration of classroom norms of mathematical inquiry, signature practices linked to these norms and case studies of primary teachers' progressive development of classroom norms of mathematical inquiry and how they facilitate learning.},

The main goal of the project is to collect a set of data that would be used by two studies to research the enacted secondary school mathematics curriculum. The project aims to examine how competent experienced secondary school teachers implement the designated curriculum prescribed by the MOE in the 2013 revision of curriculum. It does this firstly by examining the video recordings of the classroom instruction and interactions between secondary school mathematics teachers and their students, as it is these interactions that fundamentally determine the nature of the actual mathematics learning and teaching that take place in the classroom. It also examines content through the instructional materials used—their preparation, use in classroom and as homework. The project comprises a video segment and a survey segment. Approximately 630 secondary mathematics teachers and 600 students are participating in the project. The data collection for the video segment of the project is guided by the renowned complementary accounts methodology while the survey segment adopts a self-report questionnaire approach. The findings of the project will serve several purposes. They will provide timely feedback to mathematics specialists in the MOE, inform pre-service and professional development programmes for mathematics teachers at the NIE and contribute towards articulation of “Mathematics pedagogy in Singapore secondary schools” that is evidence based.},

abstract = {Persistent inequities in mathematics teaching and learning for specific groups of learners are a key challenge for researchers and educators. The use of ability grouping has been common practice in New Zealand mathematics classrooms. However, many researchers (e.g. Boaler and Wiliam 2001; Zevenbergen in 2003) highlight the negative effects of grouping and lack of opportunities for students placed in low-ability groups. The Developing Mathematical Inquiry Communities (DMIC) project is a whole-school professional development intervention designed to support a shift towards more inclusive and equitable pedagogy in the mathematics classroom. This article examines the changes in teacher beliefs about ability grouping in mathematics classrooms over time as teachers reconstruct their pedagogical practices as part of DMIC. Analysis of teacher and student interview data illustrates the ways in which the shifts in practice at the beginning of the re-invention contrasted with those at the end of the first year. We use an adaptation of Valsiner's zone theory (Valsiner 1997) to explain how the changed classroom practices supported teachers to enact more equitable practices while also constructing a more expansive view of student capability.},

abstract = {This study was conducted among 269 student teachers at 11 primary teacher training colleges in the Netherlands. To investigate their competence in integrating theory and practice in their reflections on mathematics teaching, a learning environment was designed to evoke theory use in reflections on practice. To be able to systematically describe the use of theory, we distinguished two dimensions, which we called the nature and level of theory use. A Reflection Analysis Instrument was used to univocally code the nature and level of the student teachers' theory use in the reflective notes of their final assessments into 1740 meaningful units. We found that nearly all student teachers used theory. However, they differed markedly in the way they linked theory and practice and with which depth they used theoretical concepts in their reflections. A remarkable finding of the study was the important influence of prior mathematics education on the nature and level of theory use, especially the low results of the third-year student teachers in their level of theory use. The outcome may have consequences for the design of the teacher education curricula and for the intake of first-year student teachers.},

Drawing on the philosophy of critical realism and its methodological equivalent, social realism, we analyse interview and observation data of four grade 3 teachers, with the view to identifying the mechanisms conditioning the expression of teachers' identities. In so doing, we show how post-apartheid changes in systemic roles of teachers create contradictory tensions for teachers as these bring their own mathematical learning and teaching experiences into contradiction with the new post-apartheid roles they are mandated to enact. We examine how this contradiction, together with beliefs about mathematics, pedagogy and learners, is expressed in the teaching of grade 3 mathematics. We maintain that the complementarity between teachers' beliefs and old systemic roles provides an explanation for why teachers of grade 3 mathematics have yet to ‘take-up' progressive roles. The implications point to the need for teacher development that creates enablers that lead to changes in classroom practices that align with policy-designated, progressive roles in teaching mathematics.},

Coding articles (N = 2477) for methodology, participants, mathematical domain, and theoretical orientation, we found that research on students with disabilities was overwhelmingly quantitative (81%) and tended to use behavioral and medical theoretical orientations. Research on students without disabilities was both qualitative (42%) and quantitative (42%) and tended to use constructivist and sociocultural theoretical orientations. In addition, research on mathematical learning that included students with disabilities lacked sustained qualitative inquiry documenting learning processes of students with disabilities and rarely included the teacher as an explicit focus. Following Gervasoni and Lindenskov (2011), we contend that these pronounced differences in research contribute to the segregation of students with disabilities and low-achieving students in lower quality mathematics instruction and may lead to low expectations of the mathematical competence of students with disabilities. We call for increased attention to research that considers how disability is produced and enacted in the complex context of mathematics classrooms.},

abstract = {This study examined changes in beliefs and confidence of 24 pre-service mathematics teachers after they participated in professional learning in an algebra pedagogy course, which addressed an under-researched area about their domain-specific beliefs in teaching algebra. A single-group pretest–posttest design was adopted. Quantitative data were collected to measure beliefs and confidence in teaching algebra, and qualitative data were used to help interpret and understand the results obtained from the quantitative research. Quantitative data analysis demonstrated significantly less change in beliefs than in confidence. Qualitative data analysis identified two themes accounting for changes in beliefs (learning various pedagogies and conceptually oriented teaching) and four themes accounting for changes in confidence (understanding students' learning needs, acquisition of pedagogical knowledge and approaches, designing engaging mathematical activities and tasks, and discussion with teacher and students). The course helped shift teachers' beliefs from an emphasis on performance to one on understanding and an increase in pedagogical content knowledge in algebra resulted in increased teachers' confidence. This study highlights the key to changing beliefs and confidence and the necessity of progressing from a dualistic to a relativistic orientation towards mathematics teaching.},

abstract = {The study aimed at characterising the shift from configural reasoning to proof construction in geometry. One hundred eighty-two preservice primary teachers solved two geometry problems in which they had to generate a proof from the information provided by a geometrical configuration. Results indicated that proof construction was linked to the way pre-service teachers coordinated the different apprehensions, as identified by Duval (1995), mediated by the existence of strategic knowledge. Strategic knowledge is undertood as the ability to see some specific geometrical statements as premises of a geometrical proposition that can be used to deduce intermediate statements or the conclusion. We argue that pre-service teachers need to be aware of the connections between specific geometrical facts when they construct a proof by linking visualisation to formal reasoning. We conclude with implications for teacher education programmes.},

In this analysis, we examine classroom video data of three instructors' initial implementation of an inquiry-oriented instructional unit and their implementation of the same unit one year later. We document consistent increases in instances of eliciting and building on student contributions across tasks and instructors. We then leverage Toulmin's argumentation scheme to analyze how classroom discussions became more mathematically robust and student-centered from initial to subsequent implementations. We examine how social and analytic scaffolding provided by the instructor relate to shifts in argumentation. In particular, we posit that shifts in one instructor's framing of mathematical discussion and coordination of social and analytic scaffolding fostered an increase in student contributions to mathematical arguments.

We extend this line of work in presenting the CAPS (Criteria, Affordances, Purposes, and Strategies) Framework, a framework addressing students' choices, uses, strategies, and affordances gained with examples. Based on individual interviews with 38 participants from middle school through the undergraduate level, the CAPS Framework simultaneously addresses multiple aspects of students' example-based exploration and provides a way to analyze how these different aspects mutually inform one another as students conjecture and prove. We present the framework, exemplify its use through vignettes of student thinking, and share findings on how students' thinking with examples shifts across the populations of middle school, high school, and undergraduate students.},

Such tasks can engage teachers in connecting undergraduate mathematics and secondary mathematics teaching, even when pedagogical knowledge is not needed to solve the task. We examine the phenomenon that the presence of pedagogical context appears to change the work of a mathematical task. We presented 17 practicing secondary teachers with the same set of arguments to validate, first in the context of teaching secondary mathematics, and then in the context of a university mathematics course. We argue that the construct of social positioning – as a student or teacher – explains differences in secondary teachers' validations as well as the problem of disconnection between undergraduate mathematics and secondary teaching.},

abstract = {Preservice elementary teachers (PSTs) have been described as having difficulties with fractions, relying on standard procedures, and experiencing math anxiety. We are interested in productive ways in which PSTs can and do use their prior knowledge when exploring unfamiliar paths through familiar mathematical territory. We conducted interviews with PSTs in which we challenged them with various fraction comparison tasks and encouraged them to develop new strategies. In this paper, we present a case study focused on one PST who made considerable progress in her reasoning about fraction comparisons during such an interview. We use Greeno's (1991) environment metaphor to conceptualize number sense as situated knowing in a conceptual domain. This perspective helps us account for both cognitive and affective factors. We highlight 4 themes concerning features of the mathematical environment that Jennifer (pseudonym) appeared to inhabit during the interview: (a) the interview context created a safe space that emphasized the interviewer's interest in Jennifer's ideas, as opposed to correct answers; (b) Jennifer used her prior knowledge of parts and wholes to ground her arguments meaningfully and as building blocks to invent new strategies; (c) she used her prior knowledge of cross multiplication as an established path that provided reassurance and facilitated her exploration of unfamiliar paths; (d) it was beliefs and affective factors, not deficiencies in knowledge, that constrained Jennifer's exploration of unfamiliar paths through familiar mathematical territory. We discuss the implications of these findings for research concerning PSTs' mathematical thinking and learning and for mathematics teacher education.},

We aimed at better understanding the nature of example-use across grade levels, and in particular, how judicious example-use may support students' ability to reason and prove. The paper builds on individual task-based interviews that were conducted with 12 middle school students, 16 high school students, and 10 undergraduate students, whose majors were mathematics or mathematics related. The tasks called for conjecturing and proving. In our analysis we distinguish between empirical example-use and generic example-use, and examine whether the example-uses that we identified were productive for proving, in terms of developing a proof, a deductive argument, or a sound justification that may lead to a proof. We illustrate these distinctions through ten cases drawn from the data. Our findings indicate a relatively strong tendency of students to use examples generically. They also suggest a strong, though not surprising, connection between treating examples generically and productively. Implications for practice and further research are discussed.},

During small group interviews with pairs of practicing elementary and collegiate mathematics instructors, they created tasks intended to support students' ability to create and critique mathematical arguments. From the anslysis of their written and verbal work, we found that although all instructors requested explanations in their created tasks, there were key differences in the nature of reasoning-and-proving expected. Grade 1 instructors tended to focus on empirical justifications and procedural explanation; Grade 3 and 4 instructors included similar requirements, but had more emphasis on soliciting rationales; and college instructors required students to ultimately develop more formalized arguments, consistently including requests for conjectures and generalizations. The findings provide evidence for key differences in argumentation norms at specific levels in schooling, and implications for research, teaching, and curricular design.},

Students in this study experienced an intervention for improving their argumentation and proving practices. The intervention included the eliminating counterexamples (ECE) framework as a means of constructing and critiquing viable arguments for a general claim. This framework involves constructing descriptions of all possible counterexamples to a conditional claim and determining whether or not a direct argument eliminates the possibility of counterexamples. This case study investigates U.S. eighth-grade (age 13) mathematics students' conceptions about the validity of a direct argument after the students received instruction on the ECE framework. We describe student activities in response to the intervention, and we identify students' conceptions that are inconsistent with canonical notions of mathematical proving and appear to be barriers to using the ECE framework.},

In particular, misconceptions about repeating decimals and their quotient of integer representations are recast as limited understandings of mathematics as a discipline that derives its content from representational systems and the denotations they provided. Under this framework, arguments (e.g., proofs) that convert repeating decimals to their quotient of integer representations provide content for “rational number,” which is represented in multiple ways, each offering distinct opportunities for mathematical activity. The notion of an argument as content is illustrated as arguments providing access to a concept. One Grade 8 student's struggle with understanding rational number is used to illustrate this framework and its implications for teaching and learning.},
